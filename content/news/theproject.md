## 发生啥了？

截至2023年7月12日，之前叫"Forgecord"的Discord服务器正式改名NeoForged. 

NeoForged 是一个 MinecraftForge 分支. 几乎所有之前团队的成员加入了新的团队，除了一个明显的例外———— LexManos (下称为Lex)。

这个文章会尝试导致这个突然改变的原因，它以新的团队成员视角阐释。尤其特别需要说明cpw的角度和动机。

## 为什么会这样？

首先，我（cpw）需要清楚地说明，这不仅仅是一个简单的单独的事件，而是许许多多事件叠加的结果。（译者注：此处为意译。）

在最新 Minecraft Forge 的Discord事件发生后我想, 我想了解 Curle 为什么离开了团队，正是 Lex 将她放到了这个岗位————团队领队。
她在被提拔为领队之前就是一个杰出的引领者，她在被提拔后的迅速的离开也让我感到很意外。和她的沟通让我恍然大悟————我们话费了大量时间精力
构建的团队出现了障碍，而正是Lex是这个障碍的导致者。

我想说清楚，Lex是模组社区很多很多年的问题了。几乎所有老的模组开发者12年来都和他有过不愉快的精力。我曾经，并且曾经能够说服大家不要
因为Lex放弃Forge，当Lex把一个沮丧的模组开发者成叫1000次“Cunt”，或者因为讨论其它模组平台（比如Fabric或coremods）而从网络平台封禁。

分析了我曾经所处的形势，很清楚我能做以下行动：
1. 啥都不做。如果我啥都不做，Forge项目只会慢慢分崩离析。这就是为什么当初Curle离开————尝试帮助和构建一个有用的团队，从而使Lex从步出大众视野和社区管理。
我认为，正是她的离开说明了Forge团队曾太过负能量（原文为“Toxic”）以至于无法正常运转。我们就会看到更多社区争端和歪曲（原文为“abuse”），更多的模组开发者和
社区管理者将会越来越沮丧。
2. 照顾Lex的感情. 其实这就是我近10年一直做的，但是他并不这么看待，多年来我一直为Lex辩护。我真心以为他会不再这么负能量，并且成为成功的人。
3. 做我们现在做的 - 分支项目并重新开始. 

注意！因为个人身体状况和精神状况的原因。
Note that due to personal physical and mental health issues, I was not well enough to continue with 2 and
have rather withdrawn from the community - effectively 1 - because I needed to preserve my health. Lex has argued
repeatedly that I had the power to rein him in, but that's an accident of history and not something that I believe
should have been necessary between two adult friends, and if it had killed me - a non-zero likelihood (I am not a 
young man) - then there would have been no one left anyway.

## We have forked

Yes, we have forked the project. Curle and I both agreed this was the best decision for the future of the project and
more importantly for the community - I never wanted the money or the power that comes with being leader and we
have rather started the process of putting together a simple consitution for the project moving forward, which
we will be sharing as time allows.

We have _had_ to fork - because many of the core assets are licensed by Lex's company Forge LLC. It is better for
us to fork and rebrand. We will be removing those assets that are part of the MinecraftForge project, as we develop
our own brand and styling.

Note that this is not a _hard fork_ yet. We remain compatible with existing Forge for the present time. Whether we break that
compatilibity in the future is one of many topics of discussion. Some want us to quickly clean up the technical debt,
others feel that we should take a more measured approach to that effort. Suffice to say, both opinions have some merit
and we encourage discussion and adult debate about what measures are appropriate on what timescales.

## Why did this seem so rushed?

We had been in planning and discussion for around 9 days - and had a private discord setup where we could discuss the
future direction and do work on initial setup and planning. This was well underway when I received the shock of my life
yesterday morning - for who but Lex themselves was in our private discord, reading the backlog. The reasons for this
are still unclear, and we'll likely never know the full extent of what happened, but suffice to say, the cat was 
_definitely_ out of the bag.

Faced with an unknown quantity, we felt that we had to act to quickly preserve the community, rather than risk all that
has been built, especially in the past two years. Thus we launched our rebrand, before we were truly ready, but it was in
effort to preserve the community.

## Why did you take the discord?

The discord was always mine. I set it up very early on in discord's life, originally as an experiment, but when it 
became clear that discord was getting popular, I suggested to Lex that we transition it to our new online space. At first
it was secondary to #minecraftforge on esper.net IRC, but over time, it became the primary community hub. Lex was never 
interested in taking ownership of the server, even though I offered it several times. So it is my asset, and as my 
asset, I felt it best to rebrand it.

## What happens now?

Things will settle as time passes. We should have our governance documents soon - we have good plans for a fresh approach
to governing the project. We have had **many** **_many_** offers of support and help from many many community members,
including corporations that run large hosting providers, distribution platforms and more. We will be setting up an
opencollective for those that wish to financially support the project. That financial support will be funneled directly 
back into the project - we hope to be able to help our many contributors with a little pocket money for their kind 
donations of time.

## My opinion and perspective
I want to be clear, this is my opinion and perspective. Others will have their own opinions, and they may differ in the 
details, but I believe this is the best possible future for the project as a whole.

I hope curle will write her perspective on the matter for publishing here.
